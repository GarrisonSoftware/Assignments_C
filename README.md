This repoitory contains all the code written in my first programming class at ECU. Since this is my first introduction to coding, there are many areas of the code that can be improved upon.

The repository is spilt into Assignment, In-Class, and Lab folders. 

The assignments in the Assignment folder were given to us weekly, we had longer to implement this code.
The assignments in the In-Class folder were quick coding practice tasks, we completed those during the lectures.
The assignments in the Lab folder were assigned to us during a weekly lab, they were due by the end of the day.
