This repoitory contains all the code written in my first programming class at ECU. Since this is my first introduction to coding, there are many areas of the code that can be improved upon.

The repository is spilt into **Assignment**, **In-Class**, and **Lab** folders. 

<h3>Folders</h3>
<li><b>Assignment</b>-Taks given to us weekly, we had longer to implement this code. </li>
<li><b>In-Class</b>- Quick coding practice, we completed these during the lectures.</li>
<li><b>Lab</b>- Assigned to us during a weekly lab, they were due by the end of the day. </li>
